                        Instructions for the Guessing Task

                        In this task, you will work together with your partner. Your goal is to understand your
                        partner's position on the same statements where you've just shared your own opinions. After
                        completing the tasks, you'll be asked to state your partner's positions for each of the
                        following statements, using the same scale (from 'Strongly Disagree' to 'Strongly Agree').
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-group-item lead text-center">
                        Here are the statements:
                    </li>
                    {% for s in statements %}
                        <li class="list-group-item font-italic lead text-center">
                            {{ s.text }}

                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        If your guesses are accurate, you'll receive a Â£{{ session.config.payment_for_guess }} bonus.
