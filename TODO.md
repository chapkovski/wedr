TODO list

1. Modify frontend in such a way that after the timeout users are both redirected to the Results page and the results
   are displayed.
2. make matching more complicated: not based on averages but if they disagree on at least one question and disagreement
   is needed then we can match those if we need disagreemnt
3. Make a matching page where we inform them whether they are matched with someone whom they disagree with more SALIENT.
2. Make a payoff function based on results
