                        In this study, we examine how people work together. To achieve this goal, you will need to work
                        with another member of Prolific. Your task is to decode {{ num_words }} English words.

                    <li class="list-group-item">
                        On the next few pages we will explain in detail what you should do and ask you some questions to
                        check that you have fully understood them. Then we will ask you to provide some general
                        information about yourself. This is followed by the study, which consists of {{ num_words }}
                        Tasks where you and your partner have to decode a simple English word that is decoded with
                        emojis. After all {{ num_words }} tasks have been successfully decoded, a short survey follows
                        and you
                        are redirected back to Prolific.
